## Updating Allowed Tags And Attributes

The file `class-amp-allowed-tags-generated.php` has the AMP specification's allowed tags and attributes. It's used in sanitization.
To update that file:
1. `cd` to the root of this plugin
2. run `bash bin/amphtml-update.sh`
That script is intended for a Linux environment like [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).

## Testing Media And Embed Support

The following script creates a post in order to test support for WordPress media and embeds.
To run it:
1. `ssh` into an environment like [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)
2. `cd` to the root of this plugin
3. run `wp eval-file bin/create-embed-test-post.php`
4. go to the URL that is output in the command line

## PHPUnit Testing

Please run these tests in an environment with WordPress unit tests installed, like [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).

Run tests:

``` bash
$ phpunit
```

Run tests with an HTML coverage report:

``` bash
$ phpunit --coverage-html /tmp/report
```

When you push a commit to your PR, Travis CI will run the PHPUnit tests and sniffs against the WordPress Coding Standards.

## Creating a Release

Contributors who want to make a new release, follow these steps:

1. Bump plugin versions in `package.json` (×1), `package-lock.json` (×1, just do `npm install` first), `composer.json` (×1), and in `amp.php` (×2: the metadata block in the header and also the `AMP__VERSION` constant).
2. Add changelog entry to readme.
3. Merge release branch into `master`.
4. Run `grunt deploy` to to commit the plugin to WordPress.org.
5. [Create new release](https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp/releases/new) on GitHub targeting `master`, with the new plugin version as the tag and release title. Attaching the `amp.zip` build to the release. Publish.
